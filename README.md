# PitcherPlant

PitcherPlant is a pre-processor for [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) music 
notation. It handles a number of common elements of Lilypond notation (the 
ones you use all the time but usually end up copy/pasting from an older 
document because you can never quite remember the syntax) as basic 
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) data, letting you concentrate on the music itself.
