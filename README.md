# Nepenthe - A Lilypond Preprocessor

Nepenthe (*nuh·pen·thee*) is a preprocessor for [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) music notation which uses its own document format to sidestep some of the tricker and/or harder-to-remember aspects of arranging and formatting music in Lilypond. You know, the stuff you have to look up every time.

Nepenthe documents are a hybrid of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and Lilypond, with a little bit of [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) thrown in, although you don't need to know Handlebars to use Nepenthe.

## Example

This Nepenthe document:

    ---
    version: 2.20.0
    title: A Simple Nepenthe Score
    composer: Johann Gambolputty
    ---
    \relative { c'4 e e8 g c4 | g2 c2  }

...becomes this Lilypond document:

    \version "2.20.0"

    % Preprocessed by Nepenthe v0.0.1
    % <https://tinpan-io.github.io/nepenthe/>

    \header {
    title = "A Simple Nepenthe Score"
    composer = "Johann Gambolputty"
    tagline = \markup {\with-url #"https://tinpan-io.github.io/nepenthe/" "Pre-processed with Nepenthe"}
    }
    %#############################################################################%
    \score {


        <<
                    %-- Begin part1-staff
                        \new Staff \with {
                        
                        
                        
                            \override StringNumber #'stencil = ##f           
                            \override StringNumber #'transparent = ##t
                            \clef "treble"
                    }
                    
                        {        
                            
                    \relative { c'4 e e8 g c4 | g2 c2  }
                    
                        }
                    
                    %-- End part1-staff
                    
        >>
        \layout {}
        
    }
## Who is this For?

If you're fairly comfortable with Lilypond and prefer its What-You-See-Is-What-You-Meant approach for musical notation to using a GUI tool like MuseScore, but constantly find yourself looking up where certain instructions go and/or or find yourself jumping through hoops to take the same sections of notation and output them in different formats (Notation only / Tab only / Notation + Tab, etc.) then you may like Nepenthe.

## Installation

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) (If you want to actually engrave the Lilypond files generated by Nepenthe)

### Installing with npm

Once you have Node.js installed, the most convenient way to install Nepenthe is with [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Open a terminal window and type:

    npm install -g nepenthe

### Installing from source

You can clone the Nepenthe git repository or download source code at <https://github.com/tinpan-io/nepenthe>.
