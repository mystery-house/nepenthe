# Nepenthe - A Lilypond Preprocessor

Nepenthe (*nuh·pen·thee*) is a preprocessor for [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) music notation which uses its own document format to sidestep some of the tricker and/or harder-to-remember aspects of arranging and formatting music in Lilypond. You know, the stuff you have to look up every time.

Nepenthe documents are a hybrid of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and Lilypond, with a little bit of [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) thrown in, although you don't need to know Handlebars to use Nepenthe.
