# Nepenthe - A Lilypond Preprocessor

Nepenthe (*nuh·pen·thee*) is a preprocessor for [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) music notation which uses its own document format to sidestep some of the tricker and/or harder-to-remember aspects of arranging and formatting music in Lilypond. You know, the stuff you have to look up every time.

Nepenthe documents are a hybrid of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and Lilypond, with a little bit of [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) thrown in, although you don't need to know Handlebars to use Nepenthe.

## Who is this For?

If you prefer Lilypond's What-You-See-Is-What-You-Meant approach for musical notation to using a GUI tool like MuseScore, but constantly find yourself looking up where certain instructions go and/or or find yourself jumping through hoops to take the same sections of notation and output them in different formats (Notation only / Tab only / Notation + Tab, etc.) then you may like Nepenthe.

## Installation

### Requirements
